KdRecTtau
=========

Budker INP specific library, only some snippets might be useful from outside.

This program:
1) Selects events from KEDR detector database according to some criteria;
2) Draws some parameters used in selection;
3) Is controlled by text files in input/ folder.

Unfortunately, database is local. And access to it requires some arcane libraries.
